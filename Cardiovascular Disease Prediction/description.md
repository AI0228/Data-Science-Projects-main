## Project Overview
The **Cardiovascular Disease Prediction** project aims to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in patients based on their medical records and history. By analyzing various factors, the project calculates the probability of cardiovascular disease developing in a patient. This predictive model is a valuable tool in identifying individuals who are at higher risk and enabling early intervention.

## Data Dictionary
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset with the following features:

| Feature                    | Description                                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| General Health            | General health condition of the patient.          |
| Checkup                   | Date of the patient's last medical checkup.       |
| Exercise                  | Whether the patient engages in regular exercise.  |
| Heart Disease             | Presence of existing heart disease in the patient.|
| Skin Cancer               | Presence of skin cancer in the patient.           |
| Other Cancer              | Presence of other types of cancer in the patient. |
| Depression               | Presence of depression in the patient.           |
| Diabetes                  | Presence of diabetes in the patient.              |
| Arthritis                 | Presence of arthritis in the patient.             |
| Sex                       | Gender of the patient.                           |
| Age-Category              | Age category of the patient.                     |
| BMI                       | Body Mass Index of the patient.                  |
| Smoking History           | Patient's history of smoking.                    |
| Alcohol Consumption       | Patient's alcohol consumption habits.            |
| Fruit Consumption         | Patient's consumption of fruits.                 |
| Green Vegetable Consumption | Patient's consumption of green vegetables.    |
| Fried Potato Consumption | Patient's consumption of fried potatoes.         |

## Impact
Through thorough exploratory data analysis, significant insights were revealed about the factors contributing to cardiovascular disease:

- Age plays a crucial role, with individuals above the age of 55 being more prone to cardiovascular disease. The risk escalates with age, reaching a peak in patients aged 80 and above.
- Higher BMI is correlated with an increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
- Surprisingly, exercise can have varying effects based on age. While exercise generally reduces risk, older patients who exercise extensively might face elevated risks due to increased heart strain.
- Dietary habits significantly influence the disease. Patients consuming more fruits and green vegetables exhibit lower susceptibility to cardiovascular disease, while those consuming fried potatoes are more prone.
- Smoking history is a notable risk factor.
- Intriguingly, medical history concerning cancer, arthritis, diabetes, and depression showed no significant impact on cardiovascular disease risk.

This project's predictions and insights empower healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients and implement preventive measures, ultimately reducing the prevalence of cardiovascular disease.

In conclusion, the Cardiovascular Disease Prediction project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in healthcare, aiding in the proactive management of patients' cardiovascular health.
