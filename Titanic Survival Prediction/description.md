# Titanic Survivor Prediction
![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/3136/logos/header.png)
This data science project aims to build a predictive model to answer the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data from the Titanic disaster. The project will analyze various attributes of the passengers, such as their names, ages, genders, socio-economic classes, and more, to predict the likelihood of survival.
## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic during its ill-fated voyage. It includes a range of features, including the passengers' names, ages, genders, socio-economic classes, cabin information, ticket details, and survival status.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of survival for passengers based on their individual characteristics. By analyzing the historical data and identifying patterns, the model will provide insights into the factors that influenced the chances of survival during the Titanic disaster.
## Approach
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The dataset will be carefully analyzed to handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and extract meaningful insights. Various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, will be explored and evaluated to determine the most effective model for predicting survival outcomes.
