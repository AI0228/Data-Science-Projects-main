## Project Overview:
The focus of the Demographic-Based Salary Prediction project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the salaries of individuals from diverse countries and races based on their demographic attributes. These attributes encompass a range of variables, including occupation, age, gender, experience, and education. The dataset for this project, acquired from Kaggle, comprises 32,561 rows and 15 columns, with 8 independent variables and the target variable, "Salary."
## About the Dataset:
The dataset provides an expansive compilation of salary and demographic information, augmented by details regarding years of professional experience. It serves as a valuable resource for investigating the intricate relationship between income and various socio-demographic factors. Demographic features such as age, gender, education level, country of origin, and race constitute the foundation for a comprehensive analysis. This dataset empowers researchers to uncover patterns and trends in income distribution across diverse demographic categories, shedding light on potential variations or inequalities in earning potential. Additionally, the dataset incorporates a crucial dimension - "Years of Experience" - offering a lens into the impact of accumulated professional tenure on salary levels. This dynamic facet enables in-depth exploration of how income is influenced by both demographic attributes and the evolution of professional expertise. Overall, the dataset presents an opportunity for conducting exhaustive studies on income diversity and gaining insights into the multifaceted determinants that shape earning prospects in today's workforce.
